# 第 116 场双周赛

这次双周赛感觉比上次单周难，第四题没有优化思路（后续看评论区，似乎要用线段树，不了解，有时间去研究一下），第三题写复杂了。。

## [100094\. Subarrays Distinct Element Sum of Squares I](https://leetcode.cn/problems/subarrays-distinct-element-sum-of-squares-i/)

### Description

Difficulty: **简单**


You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

The **distinct count** of a subarray of `nums` is defined as:

*   Let `nums[i..j]` be a subarray of `nums` consisting of all the indices from `i` to `j` such that `0 <= i <= j < nums.length`. Then the number of distinct values in `nums[i..j]` is called the distinct count of `nums[i..j]`.

Return _the sum of the **squares** of **distinct counts** of all subarrays of_ `nums`.

A subarray is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: 15
Explanation: Six possible subarrays are:
[1]: 1 distinct value
[2]: 1 distinct value
[1]: 1 distinct value
[1,2]: 2 distinct values
[2,1]: 2 distinct values
[1,2,1]: 2 distinct values
The sum of the squares of the distinct counts in all subarrays is equal to 12 + 12 + 12 + 22 + 22 + 22 = 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three possible subarrays are:
[1]: 1 distinct value
[1]: 1 distinct value
[1,1]: 1 distinct value
The sum of the squares of the distinct counts in all subarrays is equal to 12 + 12 + 12 = 3.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## [100104\. Minimum Number of Changes to Make Binary String Beautiful](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-number-of-changes-to-make-binary-string-beautiful/)

### Description

Difficulty: **中等**


You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` having an even length.

A string is **beautiful** if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:

*   Each substring has an **even length**.
*   Each substring contains **only** `1`'s or **only** `0`'s.

You can change any character in `s` to `0` or `1`.

Return _the **minimum** number of changes required to make the string_ `s` _beautiful_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1001"
Output: 2
Explanation: We change s[1] to 1 and s[3] to 0 to get string "1100".
It can be seen that the string "1100" is beautiful because we can partition it into "11|00".
It can be proven that 2 is the minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "10"
Output: 1
Explanation: We change s[1] to 1 to get string "11".
It can be seen that the string "11" is beautiful because we can partition it into "11".
It can be proven that 1 is the minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "0000"
Output: 0
Explanation: We don't need to make any changes as the string "0000" is beautiful already.
```

**Constraints:**

*   2 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
*   `s` has an even length.
*   `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.


## [100042\. Length of the Longest Subsequence That Sums to Target](https://leetcode.cn/problems/length-of-the-longest-subsequence-that-sums-to-target/)

### Description

Difficulty: **中等**


You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums`, and an integer `target`.

Return _the **length of the longest subsequence** of_ `nums` _that sums up to_ `target`. _If no such subsequence exists, return_ `-1`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 subsequences with a sum equal to 9: [4,5], [1,3,5], and [2,3,4]. The longest subsequences are [1,3,5], and [2,3,4]. Hence, the answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,1,3,2,1,5], target = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 5 subsequences with a sum equal to 7: [4,3], [4,1,2], [4,2,1], [1,1,5], and [1,3,2,1]. The longest subsequence is [1,3,2,1]. Hence, the answer is 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,5,4,5], target = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that nums has no subsequence that sums up to 3.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   `1 <= target <= 1000`

## [100074\. Subarrays Distinct Element Sum of Squares II](https://leetcode.cn/problems/subarrays-distinct-element-sum-of-squares-ii/)

### Description

Difficulty: **困难**


You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

The **distinct count** of a subarray of `nums` is defined as:

*   Let `nums[i..j]` be a subarray of `nums` consisting of all the indices from `i` to `j` such that `0 <= i <= j < nums.length`. Then the number of distinct values in `nums[i..j]` is called the distinct count of `nums[i..j]`.

Return _the sum of the **squares** of **distinct counts** of all subarrays of_ `nums`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

A subarray is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: 15
Explanation: Six possible subarrays are:
[1]: 1 distinct value
[2]: 1 distinct value
[1]: 1 distinct value
[1,2]: 2 distinct values
[2,1]: 2 distinct values
[1,2,1]: 2 distinct values
The sum of the squares of the distinct counts in all subarrays is equal to 12 + 12 + 12 + 22 + 22 + 22 = 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three possible subarrays are:
[2]: 1 distinct value
[2]: 1 distinct value
[2,2]: 1 distinct value
The sum of the squares of the distinct counts in all subarrays is equal to 12 + 12 + 12 = 3.
```

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
*   1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>
