## PAT (Advanced Level) 1034 Head of a Gang

One way that the police finds the head of a gang is to check people’s phone calls. If there is a phone call between A
and B, we say that A and B is related. The weight of a relation is defined to be the total time length of all the phone
calls made between the two persons. A “Gang” is a cluster of more than 2 persons who are related to each other with
total relation weight being greater than a given threthold K. In each gang, the one with maximum total weight is the
head. Now given a list of phone calls, you are supposed to find the gangs and the heads.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains two positive numbers `N` and `K` (both less
than or equal to 1000), the number of phone calls and the weight threthold, respectively. Then `N` lines follow, each in
the following format:
`Name1 Name2 Time` where `Name1` and `Name2` are the names of people at the two ends of the call, and Time is the length of
the call. A name is a string of three capital letters chosen from `A-Z`. A time length is a positive integer which is no
more than 1000 minutes.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, first print in a line the total number of gangs. Then for each gang, print in a line the name of the
head and the total number of the members. It is guaranteed that the head is unique for each gang. The output must be
sorted according to the alphabetical order of the names of the heads.

### Sample Input 1:

```text
8 59
AAA BBB 10
BBB AAA 20
AAA CCC 40
DDD EEE 5
EEE DDD 70
FFF GGG 30
GGG HHH 20
HHH FFF 10
```

### Sample Output 1:

```text
2
AAA 3
GGG 3
```

### Sample Input 2:

```text
8 70
AAA BBB 10
BBB AAA 20
AAA CCC 40
DDD EEE 5
EEE DDD 70
FFF GGG 30
GGG HHH 20
HHH FFF 10
```

### Sample Output 2:

```text
0
```

## PAT (Advanced Level) 1076 Forwards on Weibo

Weibo is known as the Chinese version of Twitter. One user on Weibo may have many followers, and may follow many other
users as well. Hence a social network is formed with followers relations. When a user makes a post on Weibo, all his/her
followers can view and forward his/her post, which can then be forwarded again by their followers. Now given a social
network, you are supposed to calculate the maximum potential amount of forwards for any specific user, assuming that
only L levels of indirect followers are counted.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive integers: `N (≤1000)`, the
number of users; and `L (≤6)`, the number of levels of indirect followers that are counted. Hence it is assumed that all
the users are numbered from 1 to N. Then N lines follow, each in the format:
`M[i] user_list[i]`
where `M[i] (≤100)` is the total number of people that `user[i]` follows; and `user_list[i]` is a list of the `M[i]` users that
followed by `user[i]`. It is guaranteed that no one can follow oneself. All the numbers are separated by a space. Then
finally a positive `K` is given, followed by `K` UserID’s for query.

### Output Specification:

For each UserID, you are supposed to print in one line the maximum potential amount of forwards this user can triger,
assuming that everyone who can view the initial post will forward it once, and that only L levels of indirect followers
are counted.

### Sample Input:

```text
7 3
3 2 3 4
0
2 5 6
2 3 1
2 3 4
1 4
1 5
2 2 6

### Sample Output:

```text
