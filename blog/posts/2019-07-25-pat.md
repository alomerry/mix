## 1099 Build A Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains
only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary
search trees. Given the structure of a binary tree and a sequence of distinct integer keys, there is only one way to
fill these keys into the tree so that the resulting tree satisfies the definition of a BST. You are supposed to output
the level order traversal sequence of that tree. The sample is illustrated by Figure 1 and 2.


### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (≤100) which is the
total number of nodes in the tree. The next N lines each contains the left and the right children of a node in the
format left_index right_index, provided that the nodes are numbered from 0 to N−1, and 0 is always the root. If one
child is missing, then −1 will represent the NULL child pointer. Finally N distinct integer keys are given in the last
line.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of that tree. All the numbers must be separated
by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

```text
9
1 6
2 3
-1 -1
-1 4
5 -1
-1 -1
7 -1
-1 8
-1 -1
73 45 11 58 82 25 67 38 42
```

### Sample Output:

```text
58 25 82 11 38 67 45 73 42
```

    }
}
int main()
{
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> tree[i].left >> tree[i].right;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> val[i];

## 1064 Complete Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains
only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary
search trees. A Complete Binary Tree (CBT) is a tree that is completely filled, with the possible exception of the
bottom level, which is filled from left to right.

Now given a sequence of distinct non-negative integer keys, a unique BST can be constructed if it is required that the
tree must also be a CBT. You are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of this BST.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N (≤1000). Then N
distinct non-negative integer keys are given in the next line. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space and
are no greater than 2000.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding complete binary search
tree. All the numbers in a line must be separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input:

```text
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
```

### Sample Output:

```text
6 3 8 1 5 7 9 0 2 4
```

### Result

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#define max_size 1001
using namespace std;
int n, flag = 1, origin_order[max_size];
int tree[max_size];
void inOrder(int index)
{
    if (index > n)
    {
        return;
    }
    else
    {
        inOrder(index * 2);
        tree[index] = origin_order[flag++];
        inOrder(index * 2 + 1);
    }
}
bool cmp(int a, int b)
{
    return a < b;
}
int main()
{
    int t;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        cin >> t;
        origin_order[i] = t;
    }
    sort(origin_order + 1, origin_order + n + 1, cmp);
    inOrder(1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        if (i != 1)
            cout << " ";
        cout << tree[i];
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## 1004 Counting Leaves

A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree. Your job is to count those family members who have no child.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0<N<100, the number of nodes in a tree,
and M (<N), the number of non-leaf nodes. Then M lines follow, each in the format:

`ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]`

where ID is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, K is the number of its children, followed by a
sequence of two-digit ID's of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 01.

The input ends with N being 0. That case must NOT be processed.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no child for every seniority level starting
from the root. The numbers must be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end
of each line.

The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where 01 is the root and 02 is its only child. Hence on the root 01
level, there is 0 leaf node; and on the next level, there is 1 leaf node. Then we should output 0 1 in a line.

### Sample Input:

```text
2 1
01 1 02
```

### Sample Output:

```text
0 1
```

### Result

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <math.h>
#define max_size 101
using namespace std;
int n, m;
map<int, int> leaf;
struct node
{
    int deepth;
    vector<int> sons;
    node()
    {
        deepth = 0;
    }
};
node tree[max_size];
bool isRoot[max_size];
void dfs(int root)
{

    if (leaf.find(tree[root].deepth) == leaf.end())
    {
        leaf[tree[root].deepth] = 0;
    }
    if (tree[root].sons.size() == 0)
    {
        leaf[tree[root].deepth]++;
        return;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < tree[root].sons.size(); i++)
    {
        int son = tree[root].sons[i];
        tree[son].deepth = tree[root].deepth + 1;
        dfs(son);
    }
}
int main()
{
    cin >> n >> m;
    fill(isRoot + 1, isRoot + n + 1, true);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    {
        int a, b, c;
        string sa, sc;
        cin >> sa >> b;
        a = (sa[0] - '0') * 10 + sa[1] - '0';
        for (int j = 0; j < b; j++)
        {
            cin >> sc;
            c = (sc[0] - '0') * 10 + sc[1] - '0';
            tree[a].sons.push_back(c);
            isRoot[c] = false;
        }
    }
    int root;
    for (root = 1; root <= n; root++)
    {
        if (isRoot[root])
            break;
    }
    dfs(root);
    for (map<int, int>::iterator it = leaf.begin(); it != leaf.end(); it++)
    {
        if (it != leaf.begin())
            cout << " ";
        cout << it->second;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## 1102 Invert a Binary Tree

The following is from Max Howell @twitter:

Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can't invert a binary tree on a whiteboard
so fuck off. Now it's your turn to prove that YOU CAN invert a binary tree!

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer `N(≤10)` which is the
total number of nodes in the tree -- and hence the nodes are numbered from 0 to N−1. Then N lines follow, each
corresponds to a node from 0 to N−1, and gives the indices of the left and right children of the node. If the child does
not exist, a - will be put at the position. Any pair of children are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in the first line the level-order, and then in the second line the in-order traversal
sequences of the inverted tree. There must be exactly one space between any adjacent numbers, and no extra space at the
end of the line.

### Sample Input:

```text
8
1 -
- -
0 -
2 7
- -
- -
5 -
4 6
```

### Sample Output:

```text
3 7 2 6 4 0 5 1

## 1043 Is It a Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains
only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary
search trees. If we swap the left and right subtrees of every node, then the resulting tree is called the Mirror Image
of a BST.

Now given a sequence of integer keys, you are supposed to tell if it is the preorder traversal sequence of a BST or the
mirror image of a BST.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N (≤1000). Then N
integer keys are given in the next line. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, first print in a line YES if the sequence is the preorder traversal sequence of a BST or the mirror
image of a BST, or NO if not. Then if the answer is YES, print in the next line the postorder traversal sequence of that
tree. All the numbers in a line must be separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

### Sample Input 1:

```text
7
8 6 5 7 10 8 11
```

### Sample Output 1:

```text
YES
5 7 6 8 11 10 8
```

### Sample Input 2:

```text
7
8 10 11 8 6 7 5
```

### Sample Output 2:

```text
YES
11 8 10 7 5 6 8
```

### Sample Input 3:

```text
7
8 6 8 5 10 9 11
```

### Sample Output 3:

```text
NO
```

## 1106 Lowest Price in Supply Chain

A supply chain is a network of retailers（零售商）, distributors（经销商）, and suppliers（供应商）-- everyone involved in moving a
product from supplier to customer.

Starting from one root supplier, everyone on the chain buys products from one's supplier in a price P and sell or
distribute them in a price that is r% higher than P. Only the retailers will face the customers. It is assumed that each
member in the supply chain has exactly one supplier except the root supplier, and there is no supply cycle.

Now given a supply chain, you are supposed to tell the lowest price a customer can expect from some retailers.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, The first line contains three positive numbers: N (≤10<sup>5</sup>), the
total number of the members in the supply chain (and hence their ID's are numbered from 0 to N−1, and the root
supplier's ID is 0); P, the price given by the root supplier; and r, the percentage rate of price increment for each
distributor or retailer. Then N lines follow, each describes a distributor or retailer in the following format:

`K~i~ ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K~i~]`

where in the i-th line, K<sub>i</sub> is the total number of distributors or retailers who receive
products from supplier i, and is then followed by the ID's of these distributors or retailers. K<sub>j</sub>
being 0 means that the j-th member is a retailer. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the lowest price we can expect from some retailers, accurate up to 4 decimal
places, and the number of retailers that sell at the lowest price. There must be one space between the two numbers. It
is guaranteed that the all the prices will not exceed 10^10^.

### Sample Input:

```text

## 1053 Path of Equal Weight

Given a non-empty tree with root R, and with weight W~i~ assigned to each tree node T~i~. The weight of a path from R to L is defined to be the sum of the weights of all the nodes along the path from R to
any leaf node L.

Now given any weighted tree, you are supposed to find all the paths with their weights equal to a given number. For
example, let's consider the tree showed in the following figure: for each node, the upper number is the node ID which is
a two-digit number, and the lower number is the weight of that node. Suppose that the given number is 24, then there
exists 4 different paths which have the same given weight: {10 5 2 7}, {10 4 10}, {10 3 3 6 2} and {10 3 3 6 2}, which
correspond to the red edges in the figure.


### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0<N≤100, the number of nodes in a tree,
M (<N), the number of non-leaf nodes, and 0<S<2~30~, the given weight number. The next line contains N positive numbers
where W~i~ (<1000) corresponds to the tree node T~i~. Then M lines follow, each in the format:

`ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]`

where ID is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, K is the number of its children, followed by a
sequence of two-digit ID's of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 00.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print all the paths with weight S in non-increasing order. Each path occupies a line with printed
weights from the root to the leaf in order. All the numbers must be separated by a space with no extra space at the end
of the line.

Note: sequence {A~1~,A~2~,⋯,A~n~} is said to be greater than sequence {B~1~,B~2~,⋯,B~m~} if there exists 1≤k<min{n,m}
such that A~i~ =B~i~ for i=1,⋯,k, and A~k+1~>B~k+1~.

### Sample Input:

```text
20 9 24
10 2 4 3 5 10 2 18 9 7 2 2 1 3 12 1 8 6 2 2

02 1 05
04 2 06 07
03 3 11 12 13
06 1 09
07 2 08 10
16 1 15
13 3 14 16 17
17 2 18 19
```

### Sample Output:

```text
10 5 2 7
10 4 10
10 3 3 6 2
10 3 3 6 2
```

## 1094 The Largest Generation

A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree where all the nodes on the same level belong to the same
generation. Your task is to find the generation with the largest population.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with two positive integers N (<100) which is the total number
of family members in the tree (and hence assume that all the members are numbered from 01 to N), and M (<N) which is the
number of family members who have children. Then M lines follow, each contains the information of a family member in the
following format:

`ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]`

where `ID` is a two-digit number representing a family member, `K(>0)` is the number of his/her children, followed by a
sequence of two-digit `ID`'s of his/her children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root `ID` to be `01`. All
the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the largest population number and the level of the corresponding generation. It is
assumed that such a generation is unique, and the root level is defined to be 1.

### Sample Input:

```text
23 13
21 1 23
01 4 03 02 04 05

## 1079 Total Sales of Supply Chain

A supply chain is a network of retailers（零售商）, distributors（经销商）, and suppliers（供应商）-- everyone involved in moving a
product from supplier to customer.

Starting from one root supplier, everyone on the chain buys products from one's supplier in a price P and sell or
distribute them in a price that is r% higher than P. Only the retailers will face the customers. It is assumed that each
member in the supply chain has exactly one supplier except the root supplier, and there is no supply cycle.

Now given a supply chain, you are supposed to tell the total sales from all the retailers.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains three positive numbers: N (≤10<sup>
5</sup>), the total number of the members in the supply chain (and hence their ID's are numbered from 0 to N−1, and the
root supplier's ID is 0); P, the unit price given by the root supplier; and r, the percentage rate of price increment
for each distributor or retailer. Then N lines follow, each describes a distributor or retailer in the following format:

`K~i~ ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K~i~]`

where in the i-th line, K<sub>i</sub>  is the total number of distributors or retailers who receive products from
supplier i, and is then followed by the ID's of these distributors or retailers. K<sub>j</sub> being 0 means that the
j-th member is a retailer, then instead the total amount of the product will be given after K<sub>j</sub>. All the
numbers in a line are separated by a space.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the total sales we can expect from all the retailers, accurate up to 1 decimal
place. It is guaranteed that the number will not exceed 10<sup>10</sup>.

#### Sample Input:

```text
10 1.80 1.00
3 2 3 5
1 9
1 4
1 7
0 7
2 6 1
1 8
0 9
0 4
0 3
```

#### Sample Output:

```text

## 1086 Tree Traversals Again

An inorder binary tree traversal can be implemented in a non-recursive way with a stack. For example, suppose that when
a 6-node binary tree (with the keys numbered from 1 to 6) is traversed, the stack operations are: push(1); push(2);
push(3); pop(); pop(); push(4); pop(); pop(); push(5); push(6); pop(); pop(). Then a unique binary tree (shown in Figure

1) can be generated from this sequence of operations. Your task is to give the postorder traversal sequence of this
   tree.


### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains a positive integer `N (≤30)` which is the
total number of nodes in a tree (and hence the nodes are numbered from 1 to N). Then 2N lines follow, each describes a
stack operation in the format: "Push X" where X is the index of the node being pushed onto the stack; or "Pop" meaning
to pop one node from the stack.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the postorder traversal sequence of the corresponding tree in one line. A solution is
guaranteed to exist. All the numbers must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end
of the line.

### Sample Input:

```text
6
Push 1
Push 2
Push 3
Pop
Pop
Push 4
Pop
Pop
Push 5

Pop
