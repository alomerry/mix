## 1011 World Cup Betting

With the 2010 FIFA World Cup running, football fans the world over were becoming increasingly excited as the best
players from the best teams doing battles for the World Cup trophy in South Africa. Similarly, football betting fans
were putting their money where their mouths were, by laying all manner of World Cup bets.

Chinese Football Lottery provided a "Triple Winning" game. The rule of winning was simple: first select any three of the
games. Then for each selected game, bet on one of the three possible results -- namely W for win, T for tie, and L for
lose. There was an odd assigned to each result. The winner's odd would be the product of the three odds times 65%.

For example, 3 games' odds are given as the following:

```
 W    T    L
1.1  2.5  1.7
1.2  3.1  1.6
4.1  1.2  1.1
```

To obtain the maximum profit, one must buy W for the 3rd game, T for the 2nd game, and T for the 1st game. If each bet
takes 2 yuans, then the maximum profit would be (4.1×3.1×2.5×65%−1)×2=39.31 yuans (accurate up to 2 decimal places).

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains the betting information of 3 games. Each game occupies a line
with three distinct odds corresponding to W, T and L.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print in one line the best bet of each game, and the maximum profit accurate up to 2 decimal places.
The characters and the number must be separated by one space.

#### Sample Input:

```
1.1 2.5 1.7
1.2 3.1 1.6
4.1 1.2 1.1
```

#### Sample Output:

```
T T W 39.31
```

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
char s[3] = {'W', 'T', 'L'};
int main()
{
    float now[3], res = 1.0;
    int k = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
        {
            scanf("%f", &now[j]);
			if (now[j] > now[k])
				k = j;
        }
        res *= now[k];
        printf("%c ", s[k]);
    }
    printf("%.2f", (res*0.65-1)*2);
    return 0;
}
```

## 1155 Heap Paths

In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a
parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal
to (in a min heap) the key of C. A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete
binary tree. (Quoted from Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure))

One thing for sure is that all the keys along any path from the root to a leaf in a max/min heap must be in
non-increasing/non-decreasing order.

Your job is to check every path in a given complete binary tree, in order to tell if it is a heap or not.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (1<N≤1,000), the number
of keys in the tree. Then the next line contains N distinct integer keys (all in the range of int), which gives the
level order traversal sequence of a complete binary tree.

#### Output Specification:

For each given tree, first print all the paths from the root to the leaves. Each path occupies a line, with all the
numbers separated by a space, and no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line. The paths must be printed in
the following order: for each node in the tree, all the paths in its right subtree must be printed before those in its
left subtree.

Finally print in a line `Max Heap` if it is a max heap, or `Min Heap` for a min heap, or `Not Heap` if it is not a heap
at all.

#### Sample Input 1:

```
8
98 72 86 60 65 12 23 50
```

#### Sample Output 1:

```
98 86 23
98 86 12
98 72 65
98 72 60 50
Max Heap
```

#### Sample Input 2:

```
8
8 38 25 58 52 82 70 60
```

#### Sample Output 2:

```
8 25 70
8 25 82
8 38 52
8 38 58 60
Min Heap
```

#### Sample Input 3:

```
8
10 28 15 12 34 9 8 56
```

#### Sample Output 3:

```
10 15 8
10 15 9
10 28 34
10 28 12 56
Not Heap
```

## Practice 1100 Mars Numbers

People on Mars count their numbers with base 13:

+ Zero on Earth is called "tret" on Mars.
+ The numbers 1 to 12 on Earth is called "jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jly, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec" on Mars,
  respectively.
+ For the next higher digit, Mars people name the 12 numbers as "tam, hel, maa, huh, tou, kes, hei, elo, syy, lok, mer,
  jou", respectively.

For examples, the number 29 on Earth is called "hel mar" on Mars; and "elo nov" on Mars corresponds to 115 on Earth. In
order to help communication between people from these two planets, you are supposed to write a program for mutual
translation between Earth and Mars number systems.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N (<100). Then N lines
follow, each contains a number in [0, 169), given either in the form of an Earth number, or that of Mars.

#### Output Specification:

For each number, print in a line the corresponding number in the other language.

#### Sample Input:

```
4
29
5
elo nov
tam
```

#### Sample Output:

```
hel mar
may
115
13
```

> 尴尬，刚开始这题想漏了。题意大概就是火星数字是13为基，给你一串字符，判断是火星数字还是地球数字后转换成另一个星球的数字

> 如果是火星数字

+ 判断字符长度是否包含两位
    + 如果包含一位 则通过map映射找到对应的数值(如果在高位map里找到了，则乘以基之后输出，否则在低位map里找到后输出)，
    + 如果包含两位 则找到高位的值乘以基再加上低位

> 如果是地球数字

+ %13获得低位 /13获得高位，只有高位或者低位则直接输出，否则中间插个空格

## 1089 Insert or Merge

According to Wikipedia:

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. Each iteration,
insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and
inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.

Merge sort works as follows: Divide the unsorted list into N sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is
considered sorted). Then repeatedly merge two adjacent sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1
sublist remaining.

Now given the initial sequence of integers, together with a sequence which is a result of several iterations of some
sorting method, can you tell which sorting method we are using?

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (≤100). Then in the
next line, N integers are given as the initial sequence. The last line contains the partially sorted sequence of the N
numbers. It is assumed that the target sequence is always ascending. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in the first line either "Insertion Sort" or "Merge Sort" to indicate the method used to
obtain the partial result. Then run this method for one more iteration and output in the second line the resuling
sequence. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique for each test case. All the numbers in a line must be separated by
a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

#### Sample Input 1:

```
10
3 1 2 8 7 5 9 4 6 0
1 2 3 7 8 5 9 4 6 0
```

#### Sample Output 1:

```
Insertion Sort
1 2 3 5 7 8 9 4 6 0
```

#### Sample Input 2:

```
10
3 1 2 8 7 5 9 4 0 6
1 3 2 8 5 7 4 9 0 6
```

#### Sample Output 2:

```Merge Sort
1 2 3 8 4 5 7 9 0 6
```

我个憨憨，判断是否插入排序的时候忘记加等于号了。。导致测试点4老是进入了归并排序的那部分。。。
