## 1125 Chain the Ropes

Given some segments of rope, you are supposed to chain them into one rope. Each time you may only fold two segments into
loops and chain them into one piece, as shown by the figure. The resulting chain will be treated as another segment of
rope and can be folded again. After each chaining, the lengths of the original two segments will be halved.

Your job is to make the longest possible rope out of N given segments.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (2≤N≤10<sup>4</sup>).
Then N positive integer lengths of the segments are given in the next line, separated by spaces. All the integers are no
more than 10<sup>4</sup>.
![PAT (Advanced Level) Practice 1125 Chain the Ropes][1]

#### Output Specification:

For each case, print in a line the length of the longest possible rope that can be made by the given segments. The
result must be rounded to the nearest integer that is no greater than the maximum length.

#### Sample Input:

```
8
10 15 12 3 4 13 1 15
```

#### Sample Output:

```
14
```

## 1126 Eulerian Path

In graph theory, an Eulerian path is a path in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. Similarly, an Eulerian
circuit is an Eulerian path which starts and ends on the same vertex. They were first discussed by Leonhard Euler while
solving the famous Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem in 1736. It has been proven that connected graphs with all
vertices of even degree have an Eulerian circuit, and such graphs are called **Eulerian**. If there are exactly two
vertices of odd degree, all Eulerian paths start at one of them and end at the other. A graph that has an Eulerian path
but not an Eulerian circuit is called **semi-Eulerian**. (Cited
from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path))

Given an undirected graph, you are supposed to tell if it is Eulerian, semi-Eulerian, or non-Eulerian.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 2 numbers N (≤ 500), and M, which are
the total number of vertices, and the number of edges, respectively. Then M lines follow, each describes an edge by
giving the two ends of the edge (the vertices are numbered from 1 to N).

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, first print in a line the degrees of the vertices in ascending order of their indices. Then in the
next line print your conclusion about the graph -- either `Eulerian`, `Semi-Eulerian`, or `Non-Eulerian`.Note that all
the numbers in the first line must be separated by exactly 1 space, and there must be no extra space at the beginning or
the end of the line.

#### Sample Input 1:

```

5 7

1 3
2 3

## 1122 Hamiltonian Cycle

The "Hamilton cycle problem" is to find a simple cycle that contains every vertex in a graph. Such a cycle is called a "
Hamiltonian cycle".

In this problem, you are supposed to tell if a given cycle is a Hamiltonian cycle.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive integers N (2<N≤200), the
number of vertices, and M, the number of edges in an undirected graph. Then M lines follow, each describes an edge in
the format `Vertex1 Vertex2`, where the vertices are numbered from 1 to N. The next line gives a positive integer K
which is the number of queries, followed by K lines of queries, each in the format:

`n V1 V2 ... Vn`
where n is the number of vertices in the list, and Vi's are the vertices on a path.

#### Output Specification:

For each query, print in a line YES if the path does form a Hamiltonian cycle, or NO if not.

#### Sample Input:

```
6 10
6 2
3 4
1 5
2 5
3 1
4 1
1 6
6 3

4 1 2 5 1
7 6 1 3 4 5 2 6
7 6 1 2 5 4 3 1
```

#### Sample Output:

```
YES
NO
NO
NO
YES
NO
```

## 1124 Raffle for Weibo Followers

John got a full mark on PAT. He was so happy that he decided to hold a raffle（抽奖） for his followers on Weibo -- that is,
he would select winners from every N followers who forwarded his post, and give away gifts. Now you are supposed to help
him generate the list of winners.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integers M (≤ 1000), N and S,
being the total number of forwards, the skip number of winners, and the index of the first winner (the indices start
from 1). Then M lines follow, each gives the nickname (a nonempty string of no more than 20 characters, with no white
space or return) of a follower who has forwarded John's post.

Note: it is possible that someone would forward more than once, but no one can win more than once. Hence if the current
candidate of a winner has won before, we must skip him/her and consider the next one.

#### Output Specification:

For each case, print the list of winners in the same order as in the input, each nickname occupies a line. If there is
no winner yet, print `Keep going...` instead.

#### Sample Input 1:

```
9 3 2
Imgonnawin!
PickMe
PickMeMeMeee
LookHere
Imgonnawin!
TryAgainAgain
TryAgainAgain
Imgonnawin!
TryAgainAgain
```

#### Sample Output 1:

```
PickMe
Imgonnawin!
TryAgainAgain
```

#### Sample Input 2:

```
2 3 5
Imgonnawin!
PickMe
```

#### Sample Output 2:

```
Keep going...
```

## 1120 Friend Numbers

Two integers are called "friend numbers" if they share the same sum of their digits, and the sum is their "friend ID".
For example, 123 and 51 are friend numbers since 1+2+3 = 5+1 = 6, and 6 is their friend ID. Given some numbers, you are
supposed to count the number of different frind ID's among them.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N. Then N positive
integers are given in the next line, separated by spaces. All the numbers are less than 10<sup>4</sup>.

#### Output Specification:

For each case, print in the first line the number of different frind ID's among the given integers. Then in the second
line, output the friend ID's in increasing order. The numbers must be separated by exactly one space and there must be
no extra space at the end of the line.

#### Sample Input:

```
8
123 899 51 998 27 33 36 12
```

#### Sample Output:

```
4
3 6 9 26
```
