# [257\. Binary Tree Paths](https://leetcode.cn/problems/binary-tree-paths/)

## Description

Difficulty: **简单**

Related Topics: [Tree](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/tree//), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/depth-first-search//), [String](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/string//), [Backtracking](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/backtracking//), [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/binary-tree//)


Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _all root-to-leaf paths in **any order**_.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
