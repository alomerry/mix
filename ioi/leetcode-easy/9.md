## Description

Difficulty: **简单**  

Related Topics: [Math](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/math//)


Given an integer `x`, return `true` _if_ `x` _is a_<span data-keyword="palindrome-integer" class=" cursor-pointer relative text-dark-blue-s text-sm"></span>


_**palindrome**_


_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121\. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**

*   -2<sup>31</sup> <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
