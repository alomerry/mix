Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a _**palindrome**_, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121\. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**

*   -2<sup>31</sup> <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
