# [94\. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.cn/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

## Description

Difficulty: **简单**  

Related Topics: [Stack](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/stack//), [Tree](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/tree//), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/depth-first-search//), [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/binary-tree//)


Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the inorder traversal of its nodes' values_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Solution

Language: **Go**
