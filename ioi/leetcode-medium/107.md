# [107\. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II](https://leetcode.cn/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/)

## Description

Difficulty: **中等**  

Related Topics: [Tree](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/tree//), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/breadth-first-search//), [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.cn/tag/https://leetcode.cn/tag/binary-tree//)


Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[15,7],[9,20],[3]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
