There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>] indicates that you **must** take course b<sub>i</sub> first if you want to take course a<sub>i</sub>.

*   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0\. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1\. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
*   `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
*   `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
*   0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < numCourses
*   All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.
